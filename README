Ceres Solver - A non-linear least squares minimizer
==================================================
Please see docs/html/index.html for a tutorial and reference.


Note: This fork is no longer supported. llvm clang now supports OpenMP natively.
However, since Xcode's clang does not support OpenMP yet, I have included a homebrew
build script, including patch, to enable ceres to use homebrew's llvm.

To install Ceres with OpenMP on OSX (as of 7 Aug 2016):
1. Download this repository's ceres-solver.rb
2. brew install llvm
3. brew install ceres-solver.rb
