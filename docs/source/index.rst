Ceres Solver is an open source C++ library for modeling and solving
large complicated `nonlinear least squares`_ problems. It is a feature
rich, mature and performant library which has been used in production
since 2010. At Google, Ceres Solver is used to:

* Estimate the pose of `Street View`_ cars, aircrafts, and satellites.
* Build 3D models for `PhotoTours`_.
* Estmate satellite image sensor characteristics.
* Stitch `panoramas`_ or apply `Lens Blur`_ on Android.
* Solve `bundle adjustment`_ and SLAM problems in `Project Tango`_.

Outside Google, Ceres is used for solving problems in computer vision,
computer graphics, astronomy and physics. e.g., `Willow Garage`_ uses
it to solve SLAM problems and `Blender`_ uses it for for planar
tracking and bundle adjustment.
